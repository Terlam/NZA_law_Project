"Hey everyone. I added a css grid to get us started for today.
We have a 5-10 minute presentation on monday so we may want 
to think about how we want to handle that soon. 

We still need someone to take on those image cards on the who and what pages.
I tried it but couldn't get it done. Let me know if anyone has any ideas
or wants to take that part of the project on. " -Terrell
